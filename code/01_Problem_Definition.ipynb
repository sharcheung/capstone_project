    "To widen its reach to the masses, TED will like to understand features which contribute to high viewership, viewership being a metric for reach. By understanding these features, such as topics or viewer habits, such as whether there are additional attributes tagged to the talk - more resources provided, follow-up actions, resources by spekears, will contribute to higher viewership. Arising from this, a predictor model will be developed to predict viewership and hence reach of future talks.   \n",
